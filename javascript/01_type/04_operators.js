// When using triple equals === in JavaScript, we are testing for strict equality. This means both the type and the value we are comparing have to be the same.

console.log(5===5)


// When using double equals in JavaScript we are testing for loose equality. Double equals also performs type coercion.
console.log(5 == '5')


// != & !==

console.log()
console.log(5 != 4) //not equal, type may equal
console.log(5 !== 4) //not equal value or not equal type
