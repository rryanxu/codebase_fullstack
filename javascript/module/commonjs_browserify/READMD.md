The `require` function is specific to Node.js and is used to import modules in a CommonJS environment. When you’re running JavaScript in a browser, this function isn’t defined, leading to the `Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined` error.

If you want to use Node.js modules like `fs` in a browser environment, you’ll need to use a tool like Browserify or Webpack, which can bundle your Node.js code into a format that’s suitable for the browser. These tools can’t handle some Node.js-specific modules like `fs` (since filesystem access is not available in browsers), so you’ll have to reconsider your approach if you need to use such modules.

Here’s a brief overview of how you might use Browserify to make your code browser-compatible:

1. **Install Browserify**: If you haven’t installed Browserify yet, you can do so using npm:

```bash
sudo npm install -g browserify
```



2. **Create an Entry File**: Move the JavaScript code you want to run in the browser to a separate file, like `main.js`.

3. **Modify Your Code**: Remove or replace code that is specific to Node.js and won’t run in a browser. This includes the `fs` module usage in your example.

4. **Bundle Your Code**: Run Browserify on your entry file to create a bundle:

   ```bash
   browserify main.js -o bundle.js
   ```



5. **Include the Bundle in Your HTML**: You can now include `bundle.js` in your HTML file using a `<script>` tag:

   ```markup
   <script src="bundle.js"></script>
   ```



You need to keep in mind that Node.js modules like `fs` that depend on server-side features won’t be usable in a browser environment, even with Browserify or similar tools. You may need to find a client-side alternative or rearchitect your application to perform these operations on the server and communicate with the client using APIs or other methods.
